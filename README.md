# Quote Protocol

Quote is a decentralized stable coin that utilizes the the Fractional Reserve and Virtual Perpetual Futures (V.P.F) mechanism to ensure stability and Capital efficiency .

Quote Protocol works on two main architectures -->

- **Public Provider**
- **Private Providers**

### Public Provider

The public provider utilizes the Virtual Perpetual Futures (V.P.F) mechanism whereby for any QUOTE minted two virtual perpetual positions (Long and Short) are created thereby making a delta neutral stability mechanism <br>
The **V.P.F** system is made possible through a two token system (QUOTE and LETH) <br>
The **QUOTE** takes the place of a short position on ETH and maintains a stable value of 1 QUOTE to $1,while **LETH** takes the place of a long Position in ETH and the value is dependent on the amount of excess collateral in the pool . <br><br>
The Public Provider ensures to maintain a minimal longs to shorts ratio of 4 ( to ensure sufficient collateral for each QUOTE minted) and a maximum of 8( to avoid over saturation of rewards for LETH holders).<br><br>

### Private Providers

Private Providers provide a Capital Efficient gateway for individuals to open Collateralized Debt Positions (C.D.P) by providing the excess collateral needed for minting QUOTE .<br><br>
**Private Providers** set their interest rates for utilizing their liquidity and when individuals open debt positions with them the excess collateral supplied by the Private Providers can not be withdrawn by the provider but can be supplied on secondary protocol (currently Aave) to earn yields while also eligible to receive interest on the debt position thereby creating the necessary incentives for persons to act as private providers and creating a competitive market and giving users flexibility in choosing options
