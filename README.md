# $QUOTE 

$QUOTE is a dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin that is backed by ETH and utilizes a virtual delta-neutral positions model to maintain stability. Currently supported on Optimism Blockchain; other blockchains coming soon. 

## How It Works
Our system operates on a dual-token mechanism comprising $QUOTE and $LETH. 

$QUOTE is a stablecoin pegged to $1, and can be minted by depositing ETH into the system and paying a small fee. Users can also burn $QUOTE tokens to redeem their collateralized ETH from the system. 

$LETH tokens signify the liquidity provided by users to the system. Users obtain $LETH tokens by adding ETH into the pool and earning yields from minting fees and potential staking rewards. They can withdraw their ETH by burning the $LETH tokens they hold, reclaiming their share of the deposited ETH from the pool.

### Stability using a virtual delta-neutral model


Delta-neutral positions use a combination of long and short contracts to hedge against price movements, effectively neutralizing the impact of underlying asset fluctuations on the value of the positions.


To keep $QUOTE pegged to a dollar, we utilize a virtual delta-neutral model on ETH while using $LETH to absorb the market volatility.

### Liquidity pool


Our liquidity pool maintains a minimum ratio of 1:4 of $QUOTE to $ETH and a maximum ratio of 1:8, to ensure stability and capital allocation. Users predominantly contribute liquidity by depositing $ETH into the pool and receiving $LETH tokens in return. $LETH's value fluctuates with changes in the price of $ETH, while $QUOTE stays stable.

Assuming there is 1 ETH in the pool at $4000/ETH with 250 $QUOTE in circulation, an equivalent value of $500 worth of ETH in the pool would back this while the rest of the pool ($3500) would be represented by $LETH tokens. If ETH drops to $3000/ETH, more $ETH from the pool is utilized to back the value of $QUOTE, reducing the price of $LETH. Conversely, if there's an increase in the price of $ETH, the value of $QUOTE remains stable while the price of $LETH increases accordingly.

## Governance
At QUOTE, we believe in the importance of decentralized governance to empower our community and ensure the platform's long-term success. We'd be introducing a DAO where $LETH holders can vote on the minting fees, yield rates, platform upgrades and other important matters. All governance proposals and voting outcomes would be publicly available on-chain, ensuring transparency and accountability in decision-making.
